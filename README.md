## Data Wrangling of the WeRateDogs Twitter Archive

The dataset is the tweet archive of Twitter user (@dog_rates)[https://twitter.com/dog_rates], also known as WeRateDogs. 
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. 
These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. 
Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." 
WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.
